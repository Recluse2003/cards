This README will explain how to run the tests for this project.

Prerequisites:
Before running the tests, ensure the following:
  - Java Development Kit (JDK) version 23.0.1 or later is installed. Earlier versions may work, 
    however this was only tested in this version as it was the lastest version at the time of 
    development. 
  - Visual Studio Code is installed and the java extension pack is also installed. 
    - Note: If java platform extension for visual studio code by oracle corportation is 
      installed in VSC, it shows the JUnit imports and methods as errors, but tests still work
      for unknown reasons. 


Running tests in VSC:
1. Open the Testing tab on the Activity bar on the left hand side
2. The test explorer tab should display all detected test classes and methods
3. Click the Run Tests button at the top of tab to run all tests, or perform individual tests
   by hovering over the individual test methods and click run test. 


Note: Do not delete packs with the word test in their name, as they are needed for some of the
      unit tests
